/**
 * The name a `new` CONSTRUCTS, as the graph names it — or null when this pass cannot
 * say, in which case the construction resolves to nothing.
 *
 * Erasing type arguments is the only transformation here, because it is the only one
 * that provably does not change which type is being named:
 *
 *     Box            -> Box
 *     Box<String>    -> Box     (the node is `Box`; the arguments are not part of it)
 *     Box<>          -> Box
 *
 * A QUALIFIED name is deliberately dropped rather than reduced to its final segment:
 *
 *     java.io.File   -> null    (not the repo's own `File`)
 *     Beta.Builder   -> null    (not `Alpha.Builder` in the same file)
 *
 * Collapsing those was the first attempt at this fix, and it traded lost edges for
 * WRONG ones — `new java.io.File(…)` resolved to an unrelated in-repo `File`, and a
 * nested `Beta.Builder` bound to a sibling `Alpha.Builder` at `extracted` confidence,
 * because the same-file tiebreak takes the first candidate. Dropping keeps this pass
 * on the resolver's own rule: resolve precisely, or not at all.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT shared with bindings.ts's `javaTypeName`. That one answers "what
 * type does this variable HOLD", where reducing `java.util.List` to `List` is a local
 * heuristic with different stakes; this one answers "what type is being constructed",
 * and the two questions do not have the same safe answer. Supporting qualified
 * construction properly needs an import-aware type index, not a longer helper.
